So why do we fail to achieve it many a times ?

<span style="color: #ff0000;">It's the poison of Negativity.</span>
<ol>
 	<li>If someone put poison in your water, would you drink it? The obvious answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô! Chemical poisons that we can see, taste, touch and smell can be fatal. Fortunately, we are intelligent enough to know that we do not ingest ourselves with poisonous substances.</li>
 	<li>Similarly, we have to remove out negativity harmful to our <strong>MIND</strong>¬†.¬†Negativity is the poison that prevents us from achieving our dreams. Hence we need to stop it before it contaminates our lives.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Why positive thoughts are necessary to achieve your Dreams?</h5>
Negativity starts with negative thoughts. Every thought, goes out into the universe as energy and goes on forever. Hence be¬†<strong>careful</strong> what you think about. Positive thoughts will spell success whereas negative thoughts will result in failures because -
<ol>
 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The universe does not distinguish between a thought that is positive and one that is negative.</strong></span></li>
 	<li>‚ÄòA thought is like a seed that is planted in the ground‚Äô.</li>
 	<li>The universe will provide the seed with the energy to manifest that thought into material form.</li>
 	<li>Mother Nature, who is also natural energy, does not care if it is the seed of a weed or the seed of a flower. It will begin to grow.</li>
 	<li>How well it will grow will depend on a number of other elements. Eg: how much additional energy the seed /thought is given.</li>
 	<li>The primary laws that work with <strong>thought</strong> are the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ‚ÄòLaw and Attraction‚Äô</span> and the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ‚ÄòLaw of Gestation‚Äô</span>.</li>
 	<li>Law of Attraction: takes that thought, and starts to draw to you like energy to manifest that thought into Form.</li>
 	<li>Law of Gestation: dictates that there is a period of time that must elapse before that thought will manifest in Form. The length of that time is dependent on the magnitude and intensity of the energy of the thought.</li>
</ol>
<h6><b>Simple steps to help you achieve your Dreams -</b></h6>
<ul>
 	<li>Monitor the thoughts that you allow into your mind. If you find yourself thinking negative thoughts, think again. Think positive, empowering and supportive thoughts. It is that simple!.¬†Here‚Äôs an idea to help you accomplish this:Place an elastic band around your wrist. Every time you think a negative thought, snap the elastic. Within a short period of time you will likely stop thinking negative. Or you will have a very sore wrist.</li>
 	<li>Just as you monitor your thoughts, monitor the words that you speak. Listen carefully to every word that is coming from your mouth. When you hear yourself complaining, stop yourself immediately.</li>
 	<li>Create a vocabulary of a successful, positive, inspiring individual. Be passionate in your speech and express you enthusiasm with your words. The energy of the words that you speak is powerful force that is creative. Create positive affirmations to support your goals and read them aloud each and everyday.</li>
 	<li>‚ÄúBe appreciative and show appreciation to others‚Äù.</li>
 	<li>Gratitude alone is one state of being that will attract to you more of things that you desire. Negativity is the anchor that holds you back. Cut yourself free today.</li>
 	<li>Eliminate the negativity that holds you back from realizing your dreams and be the most positive, optimistic person that you know.</li>
