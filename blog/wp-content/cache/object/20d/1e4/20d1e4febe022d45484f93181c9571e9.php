Physical activity plays a vital role in maintaining both physical health and emotional well-being. By adhering to a fitness routine, you can reap two primary benefits:

Weight Management: Engaging in physical activity helps your body utilize excess calories that would otherwise be stored as fat. By striking a balance between the calories consumed and those expended through exercise, you can effectively control your weight.

Reduced Risk of Chronic Diseases: Regular physical activity is associated with a lower risk of developing various chronic diseases. Health experts recommend aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week. This translates to a manageable commitment of just 20 minutes a day, significantly less time than we often spend on social media updates.
