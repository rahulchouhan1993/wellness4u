<h5>What is well-being?</h5>
Achieving well-being has been the concern of philosophers since Aristotle, and is, in many respects the essence of human existence. In recent years, well-being has moved from the realm of philosophy to that of science. There has been a growing body of research into what contributes to the quality of peopleâ€™s experiences of their lives. This has enabled a new understanding of the factors that both influence and constitute well-being.

The science of â€˜subjective well-beingâ€™ suggests that as well as experiencing good feelings, people need:
<ul>
 	<li>a sense of individual vitality</li>
 	<li>to undertake activities which are meaningful, engaging, and which make them feel competent and autonomous</li>
 	<li>a stock of inner resources to help them cope when things go wrong and be resilient to changes beyond their immediate control.</li>
</ul>
It is also crucial that people feel a sense of relatedness to other people, so that in addition to the personal, internally focused elements, peopleâ€™s social experiences â€“ the degree to which they have supportive relationships and a sense of connection with others â€“ form a vital aspect of well-being.

Defining well-being is complex, but lets see what few interesting ones -

â€œWe must turn to nature itself to the observations of the body in health &amp; in disease to learn the truthâ€Â  .....Â <strong>Hippocrates</strong>

â€œThe Doctor of the future will give NO medicine but will interest his patient in the care of human frame, in diet &amp; in the cause &amp; prevention of diseaseâ€Â  Â  .....Â  Â <strong>Thomas EdisonÂ </strong>

â€œHealth is a state of complete physical, mental &amp; social Wellbeing &amp; not merely absence of disease &amp; infirmityâ€Â  Â .....Â  <strong>World Health Organization</strong>

â€œHealth is not only to be well but to use well every power we haveâ€Â  Â  ...Â  Â <strong>Florence Nightingale</strong>

While academic debate continues about precisely how â€˜well-beingâ€™ should be defined, for our purposes it is not essential to address all of its finer points. All of the elements cited above play a role in ensuring that people feel their lives are going well, although their importance may vary as circumstances change.

Well-being is most usefully thought of as the dynamic process that gives people a sense of how their lives are going, through the interaction between their circumstances, activities and psychological resources or â€˜mental capitalâ€™. The 2008 UK GovernmentÂ <a href="http://www.foresight.gov.uk/OurWork/ActiveProjects/Mental%20Capital/Welcome.asp">Foresight Project</a>Â drew onÂ <a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/z_sys_PublicationDetail.aspx?PID=266">key thinkingÂ </a>commissioned fromÂ <strong>nef</strong>Â to define well-being in similar terms.

Because of this dynamic nature, high levels of well-being mean that we are more able to respond to difficult circumstances, to innovate and constructively engage with other people and the world around us. As well as representing a highly effective way of bringing about good outcomes in many different areas our lives, there is also a strong case for regarding well-being as an ultimate goal of human endeavour.
