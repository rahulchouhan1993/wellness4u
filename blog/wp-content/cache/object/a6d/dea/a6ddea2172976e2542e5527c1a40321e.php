Sit with the soles of your feet together, knees pointing outward. Pull your feet as close into your groin as possible. Then gently push your knees towards the floor. Hold for 15 counts.

Stand up straight, then bend one knee so your heel touches your buttocks. Hold for 30 seconds and repeat with the other leg.

Slowly bend forward from your waist, letting your back and shoulder relax as you stretch toward your toe. Reach down as far as you can and hold for 15 counts.

Rotate your head to the right for one count, then rotate your head back for one count, stretching your chin to the ceiling and letting your mouth open. Rotate your head to the left for one count, and finally, drop your head to your chest for one. Known as the stress-butcher stretch.

Lift your right shoulder up toward your ear, then lift your left shoulder up for one count as you lower your right shoulder.

Lying on your back, bring one knee to the chest and keep the other leg out straight. Turn head toward the extended leg. Hold, return at starting position, then reverse.

Clasp your hands together as if you are about to pray fervently. Squeeze them together and hold for 30 seconds. This is great for those working with computers all day long.

Sit on a chair, feet on the floor. Lift leg until it is parallel to the floor and in a straight line with the knee. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat with the other leg.
